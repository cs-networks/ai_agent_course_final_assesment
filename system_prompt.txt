YOUR FINAL ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.

If you are asked for a number, don't use comma to write your number neither use units such as $ or percent sign unless specified otherwise.
If you are asked for a string, don't use articles, neither abbreviations (e.g. for cities), and write the digits in plain text unless specified otherwise.
If you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending of whether the element to be put in the list is a number or a string.
If you are asked for a time, always answer numerically.
